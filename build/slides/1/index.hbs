<p class="explanation">
  Drawing lines on the JavaScript canvas works analagous to drawing with a pen. You move to a point, then draw a line from that point to another point. But, by default drawing lines on the canvas produces blurry lines.
</p>

<p class="explanation">Both of the lines below should be red <span style="color: white; background-color: #FF0000; padding: 2px; border-radius: 1px; font-size: 13px;">(#FF0000)</span>, but the horizontal line is light-red or pink. The canvases in this demo are scaled up 3x (you can turn this off below), but the diagonal line looks both jagged and blurry.</p>

  <pre><code>
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(10, 0);
    ctx.lineTo(10, 90);
    ctx.moveTo(20, 0);
    ctx.lineTo(70, 50);
    ctx.stroke();
    ctx.closePath();
  </code></pre>
